# Getting Started

Welcome to the Gemini MCP Tool! This guide will help you get up and running in minutes.

## TLDR Quick Start

1. **Install** - Ask Claude naturally to use Gemini, save tokens
2. **Configure** - Add this to your Claude config:
   ```json
   "gemini-cli": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "gemini-mcp-tool"]
   }
   ```
3. **Use** - Run `claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop` where you want to use gemini-cli as an MCP
4. **Select** - Make sure you've selected the MCPs you want to import (defaults to all)
5. **Run** - Execute `claude code` in the same directory - it's now configured!

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** v16.0.0 or higher
- **[Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** installed and configured on your system
- **Claude Desktop** or **Claude Code** with MCP support

### Installing Gemini CLI

```bash
# Install the Gemini CLI first
pip install google-generativeai-cli

# Configure with your API key
gemini config set api_key YOUR_API_KEY

# Verify it works
gemini -help
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using npx (Recommended - No Installation!)

This is the simplest approach - no global installation needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "gemini-mcp-tool"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Global Installation

If you prefer a traditional global install:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g gemini-mcp-tool

# Then use this configuration:
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini-cli": {
      "command": "gemini-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration File Locations

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

::: tip
After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop completely for changes to take effect.

## Using with Claude Code

For Claude Code users, there's an even simpler approach:

```bash
# In your project directory
claude mcp add gemini-cli -- npx -y gemini-mcp-tool

# This automatically configures the MCP for your project
```

## Verify Your Setup

Once configured, test that everything is working:

### 1. Basic Connectivity Test
Type in Claude:
```
/gemini-cli:ping "Hello from Gemini MCP!"
```

### 2. Test File Analysis
```
/gemini-cli:analyze @README.md summarize this file
```

### 3. Test Sandbox Mode
```
/gemini-cli:sandbox create a simple Python hello world script
```

## Quick Command Reference

Once installed, you can use natural language or slash commands:

### Natural Language Examples
- "use gemini to explain index.html"
- "understand the massive project using gemini"
- "ask gemini to search for latest news"

### Slash Commands in Claude Code
Type `/gemini-cli` and these commands will appear:
- `/gemini-cli:analyze` - Analyze files or ask questions
- `/gemini-cli:sandbox` - Safe code execution
- `/gemini-cli:help` - Show help information
- `/gemini-cli:ping` - Test connectivity

## Common Issues

### "Command not found: gemini"
Make sure you've installed the Gemini CLI:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai-cli
```

### "MCP server not responding"
1. Check your configuration file path
2. Ensure JSON syntax is correct
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### "Permission denied"
On macOS/Linux, you might need to make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x contribution/*.sh
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up:
- Learn about file analysis with @ syntax
- Explore sandbox mode for safe code execution
- Check out real-world examples in the README
- Join the community for support
